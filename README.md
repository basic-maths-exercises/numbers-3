# Getting all the digits

Hopefully, given the tasks you have completed you can see how to extend the two functions you have written to determine the third digit (the number of tens) and the final digit (the number of ones) of a four-digit number.   In this exercise, you to use what you have learned to complete the function `getNumberArray`.  This function should take an integer with a value less than or equal to 9999, which we shall call `N` as input.  The function will then return a NumPy array.  The zeroth element in this numpy array should be the number of thousands, the first element the number of hundreds, the third digit the number of tens and the final digit should be the number of ones.

If your function is working when the number 5623 is passed to the function and the output is printed it should read:

````
[3,2,6,5]
````
